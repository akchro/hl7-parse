# HL7 LiteBoard

A lightweight, clinician-friendly solution that ingests HL7 data streams and presents them in a digestible, editable, and exportable format. Built for healthcare professionals to bridge the gap between complex HL7 standards and daily clinical workflows.

## 🚀 Overview

HL7 LiteBoard translates complex HL7 v2 messages into a clean, interactive dashboard, allowing healthcare professionals to quickly review, update, and generate patient records in familiar formats (PDF, JSON, XML). This tool reduces intake and discharge times while lowering integration costs for healthcare systems.

## 🏥 Problem Statement

- **Complexity of HL7**: HL7 v2 is the backbone of healthcare interoperability, but its structure is highly technical and difficult for non-technical users to interpret
- **Cost of Integration**: Hospitals spend significant resources on interface engines and consultants to manage HL7 data
- **Workflow Inefficiencies**: Patient intake and discharge involve multiple handoffs, resulting in delays, redundant data entry, and errors
- **Accessibility Gap**: Non-technical healthcare staff cannot easily read, update, or act on HL7 data without IT involvement

## 💡 Solution

HL7 LiteBoard provides a simplified interface that:

- **Ingests** HL7 v2 messages (e.g., ADT for admissions, ORU for labs)
- **Transforms** and displays patient information in an intuitive dashboard
- **Enables** real-time edits to key fields (allergies, medications, discharge notes)
- **Generates** updated HL7/FHIR messages to maintain interoperability
- **Provides** one-click export in PDF, JSON, or XML formats for easy sharing and record-keeping

This system acts as a translation and interaction layer between hospital systems and healthcare professionals, improving usability without requiring deep technical expertise.

## 📋 Features

### Core Functionality
- **HL7 Message Ingestion**: Supports ADT, ORU, and other HL7 v2 message types
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Clean, clinician-friendly interface for patient data
- **Real-time Editing**: Modify allergies, medications, and discharge notes directly
- **Multi-format Export**: Generate PDF, JSON, and XML reports with one click
- **FHIR Compatibility**: Maintains interoperability with modern healthcare standards

### Workflow Benefits
- Reduces patient intake and discharge processing time
- Eliminates redundant data entry
- Minimizes errors through intuitive interfaces
- Lowers dependency on IT staff for HL7 data management

## 🏗️ Architecture

HL7 LiteBoard acts as a middleware solution that:
1. **Receives** HL7 v2 messages from hospital systems
2. **Parses** and transforms data into structured JSON
3. **Presents** information through an intuitive web interface
4. **Captures** clinician updates and modifications
5. **Generates** updated HL7/FHIR messages for system integration

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Emergency Department**: Quick patient intake and status updates
- **Laboratory Results**: Clean presentation of ORU messages for clinicians
- **Patient Transfers**: Streamlined ADT message management during care transitions
- **Discharge Planning**: Efficient preparation and export of discharge summaries
